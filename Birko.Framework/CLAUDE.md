## Architecture

### Store Hierarchy (Template Method Pattern)
```
AbstractStore -> AbstractBulkStore (sync)
AbstractAsyncStore -> AbstractAsyncBulkStore (async)
```

Stores use lazy-init: CRUD methods auto-call `Init()`/`InitAsync()` before first use (via `EnsureInitialized`/`EnsureInitializedAsync` with double-checked locking). Concrete stores override `*Core` methods (e.g., `CreateCoreAsync` instead of `CreateAsync`). Public methods are `virtual` on the base class.

### SQL Stores
```
DataBaseStore<DB,T> -> DataBaseBulkStore<DB,T> (sync)
AsyncDataBaseStore<DB,T> -> AsyncDataBaseBulkStore<DB,T> (async)
```

⚠ **This is a SEPARATE hierarchy — it does not derive from `AbstractBulkStore` / `AbstractAsyncBulkStore`
above.** `DataBaseStore<DB,T>` descends from `AbstractStore<T>` / `AbstractAsyncStore<T>`, but the *bulk*
tier implements `IBulkStore<T>` / `IAsyncBulkStore<T>` **directly** and carries its own copies of the
collection and filter-based overloads — which is why it also declares its own private `RequireFilter`. The
two diagrams sitting next to each other read as one chain and are not: anything wired "into the base bulk
store" reaches the portable backends (JSON, XML, InMemory, MongoDB, RavenDB, CosmosDB, InfluxDB) and
**not** the SQL ones. Measured cost of assuming otherwise: TASK-215's whole-table write guard was absent
from every SQL provider for a fortnight, so `Update(x => !empty.Contains(x.Name), action)` rewrote every
row of the table with no exception on the framework's default provider (TASK-329, § Conventions).

### Repository Hierarchy
```
AbstractRepository -> AbstractBulkRepository (sync)
AbstractAsyncRepository -> AbstractAsyncBulkRepository (async)
```

### Settings Chain (Birko.Configuration)
```
ISettings (GetId)
  -> Settings (Location, Name)
    -> PasswordSettings (+Password)
      -> RemoteSettings (+UserName, +Port, +UseSecure)
        -> SqlSettings (+CommandTimeout, +ConnectionTimeout, abstract GetConnectionString)
          -> MSSqlSettings (+MultipleActiveResultSets, +TrustServerCertificate)
          -> MySqlSettings (+BulkInsertBatchSize)
          -> PostgreSqlSettings (+UseBinaryImport)
          -> TimescaleDBSettings (+TimeColumn, +ChunkTimeInterval)
    -> SqLiteSettings (+CommandTimeout, Path, GetConnectionString) — extends PasswordSettings
    -> CosmosDB Settings (+PartitionKeyPath, +RequestTimeout, +AllowBulkExecution, GetCosmosClientOptions)
    -> RavenDB Settings (+RequestTimeout, CreateDocumentStore)
    -> MongoDB Settings (+AuthDatabase, +ReplicaSet, GetConnectionString) — already existed
    -> RedisSettings (+Database, +KeyPrefix, GetConnectionString) — already existed
```

### Dependency Flow

The full layering graph moved to [CLAUDE-projects.md](CLAUDE-projects.md) § Dependency Flow, beside
the catalog it describes — **that file is the one producer; edit the graph there, not here.** Consult
it before adding any project reference: the graph is what says whether an edge is legal, and a leaf
documented as "zero deps" is a promise consumer aggregators rely on.

### Reference Implementations
- **ElasticSearch** store — reference for async/bulk operations
- **JSON** store — reference for file-based storage
- **XML** store — reference for file-based storage with `System.Xml.Serialization` (note: no native `Dictionary` support — use wrapper types)
- **InMemory** store (`Birko.Data.InMemory`) — simplest possible store (thread-safe `ConcurrentDictionary`, no persistence); the canonical test double / prototyping backend

## Usage in Consumer Solutions

When using Birko.Framework projects in your solution, create **one or more aggregator library projects** that bundle the `Birko.*` shared projects you need (e.g. `FisData.Birko`, `Symbio.Birko`, or split by layer like `{Solution}.Birko.Core` + `{Solution}.Birko.Edge` + `{Solution}.Birko.Ai`). Your other projects reference the aggregator(s) instead of importing `.projitems` directly. Default to a single aggregator; split only when concrete pain shows up — bloated binaries, leaky transitive deps, or unused-heavy-dependency pull-ins (camera, AI, hardware). This avoids compilation and transitive reference issues that arise when multiple projects import overlapping sets of shared projects independently.

Use `$(BirkoSrc)` (resolved from a root `Directory.Build.props`) for all `Import Project="…\Birko.X\Birko.X.projitems"` paths instead of hard-coded absolutes. The property reads `/p:BirkoSrc=…` first, then the `BIRKO_SRC` environment variable, then defaults to the `Birko\Framework` checkout relative to the consumer repo (the recommended layout nests the framework under a `Birko\Framework` bucket with consumers under a sibling `Birko\Consumers`, so the default resolves `..\..\Framework`; flat-sibling checkouts would use `..`). TypeScript bundlers consuming `Birko.Web.*` sources resolve a **separate `Birko\Web` bucket** — the frontend libs (`Birko.Web.Core` / `.Components` / `.Shell`) live there, apart from the .NET `Birko\Framework`. Their `build.js` walks up to find `Birko\Web` (or honors `BIRKO_SRC`). So the two builds resolve sibling buckets: `Birko\Framework` for MSBuild, `Birko\Web` for esbuild. See [README — Usage in Consumer Solutions](README.md#usage-in-consumer-solutions) for the full pattern.

## Conventions

Day-to-day API conventions are below. **The rulebook proper — 65 rules, each with the measurement that
earned it — lives in [CLAUDE-conventions.md](CLAUDE-conventions.md).** The index after these bullets carries
each rule's opening statement so you can tell whether one applies; open that file for the reasoning,
the counter-examples and the measurements. They are not optional: every one exists because the defect
it describes shipped, and several because it shipped twice.

- All stores implement: `IStore`, `IAsyncStore`, `IBulkStore`, `IAsyncBulkStore`
- All repositories implement: `IRepository`, `IAsyncRepository`, `IBulkRepository`, `IAsyncBulkRepository`
- Bulk stores support filter-based Update/Delete: `Update(filter, PropertyUpdate<T>)`, `Update(filter, Action<T>)`, `Delete(filter)`
- Use `PropertyUpdate<T>` for native platform operations (SQL SET, MongoDB $set/$inc, ES UpdateByQuery); use `Action<T>` for complex mutations. A counter is `Increment` / `Decrement`, never a read-modify-write `Action<T>`
- New platform stores should override `Update(filter, PropertyUpdate<T>)` and `Delete(filter)` for native performance — translating every `PropertyAssignment` through `Match(set, increment)`: an increment is `col = col + delta`, never a Set of the delta. A kind that must not be mishandled is a closed hierarchy reached through `Match`, not an enum beside a shared `Value` (TASK-498)
- On a bulk store, `Read(filter)` returns the **collection** (`IEnumerable<T>`), not a single entity: the bulk `Read(filter, orderBy, limit, offset)` overload hides the inherited single-result `Read(filter)` from member lookup (C# only considers the most-derived type that declares the method name). Use `ReadFirst(filter)` / `ReadFirstAsync(filter)` (on `IBulkReadStore<T>` / `IAsyncBulkReadStore<T>`) for a single result, or cast to `IReadStore<T>` / `IAsyncReadStore<T>`
- Concrete stores override `protected *Core` methods (e.g., `CreateCoreAsync`, `ReadCore`), **NOT** the public CRUD methods. The base class handles lazy-init in the public wrapper
- Use protected setters for properties that derived classes need to modify
- `RemoteSettings` should be passed via `base.SetSettings()`, not constructed inline

### The rulebook — index to [CLAUDE-conventions.md](CLAUDE-conventions.md)

Search that file for the phrase to reach the full rule.

1. A destructive all-rows operation is named `*All`; only reading everything gets the short name
2. That rule is not about SQL — it is about any write whose scope can silently become "everything", in any backend
3. A scope guard tests what the statement MEANS, never whether text was produced — and an always-true term is reduced away, never rendered
4. Fifth instance of the scope-guard family, and the first where the filter is DATA rather than a predicate: a migration's JSON filter
5. A nullable filter argument means "do not filter" or it means a value — decide once, and check what the backend's query language does with null, because one dialect will silently turn it into MATCH NOTHING
6. A write that opens its own connection cannot be inside anybody's transaction — and a boundary is only as wide as its NARROWEST participant
7. Schema-ensure PARTICIPATES in the caller's boundary, and a participating schema-ensure is not remembered — because "initialised" must mean "the schema is durably there", not "I ran the DDL once"
8. A blast radius is a measurement with an expiry date, and a stale one can argue for the wrong decision in either direction
9. An exception's TYPE is a contract three mechanisms select on, so rewrap only where the rewrap earns something — and enumerate the filters before you replace an exception in flight
10. A remedy is priced on the STEADY STATE, not on the reproduction that found the defect — and a knob may only offer what the mechanism can actually deliver
11. A load defect is reproduced by matching the CONCURRENCY SHAPE, not by turning the load up — and the shape that mattered here was several callers per table, not more tables at once
12. Bookkeeping a rule depends on goes in a NON-VIRTUAL wrapper around a `*Core` seam — putting it in the virtual method means it runs on exactly the providers that did not override
13. Ask the question of the ERROR, not of the statement — and when a justification says "a false positive is harmless here", check whether that is still true
14. A durability question must be asked while the thing that makes it durable is still in scope — and a rule enforced in a base class about state a derived class publishes and withdraws is a rule enforced at the wrong moment
15. An identifier that reaches interpolated SQL is resolved against table metadata, never validated as text — and the two sinks share one lookup
16. A name that one layer CREATES and another layer READS BACK has exactly one producer
17. Quote table identifiers; never quote column identifiers
18. A qualifier resolves against a bare ALIAS, not against a quoted table — and that is what makes the rule above total instead of per-sink
19. An identifier that reaches SQL as a string VALUE rather than as an identifier must be PRE-FOLDED — the parser's case-folding never runs on it, and that is the opposite of the quoting rule above
20. Those two treatments have ONE producer each, on the connector — and the escaping underneath them has one producer for the whole framework
21. A provider whose paging syntax has a precondition needs that precondition supplied where it is KNOWN, not where the clause is rendered — and a feature nobody tested is a feature nobody has
22. A WRITE that cannot be applied must never report success — and "recover and continue" is not a thing a handler can do if it neither repairs nor retries
23. A diagnostic that rides on a THROWN exception is blind on every path that answers instead of throwing — and the path that answers is where the wrong answer lives
24. A recovery branch is only as good as the state it can actually reach — and a promise made in one class about a flag owned by another is a promise nobody keeps
25. A diagnostic channel must survive its own subscriber — and the damage a throwing handler does is not where you look for it
26. A reader that answers an ERROR with an empty result is giving a wrong answer, so what it swallows must be exactly one thing
27. A decorator never writes to an object the inner store returned, and it never persists the caller's object with a value that belongs somewhere else — the two halves are one rule, and CAPTURE-AND-RESTORE satisfies neither
28. A value that a driver INFERS a type for and a value the framework types EXPLICITLY are two producers, and the inferring one fails quietly
29. A column has ONE meaning, so a type that can mean two things needs an opt-in — and the opt-in promises only what the weakest provider can keep
30. A query against another product's catalogue has an expiry date, and nothing in the type system says so — write the version down
31. A name a CALLER supplies may be qualified; a name the framework resolved never is — and quoting the whole string conflates them
32. Birko's OWN bookkeeping tables are dialect-rendered like anything else — and the bare-column rule two entries up does NOT extend to them
33. A bare-emitted identifier has no enclosure, so its containment is REFUSAL — the third mechanism, and the guard that provides it is separated from its sibling by the MESSAGE, not by the check
34. A parameter documented as "SQL" has no containment story, so the fix is the API's SHAPE, never a validator — and where the fix needs an open set, a validated IDENTIFIER contains it without closing it
35. A statement the server refuses inside a transaction is a provider limit the framework must ROUTE AROUND, and the statements in one family will not all need the same treatment — one may be fixable in place and its neighbour not at all
36. Per-caller, per-operation state never goes on a process-wide cached object — and when the last user of such a mechanism moves off it, the mechanism goes too
37. A column type is only correct for the operations the provider allows ON it — and where a key restricts the type, "is this column an index key" is resolved ONCE, never OR'd at a connector
38. An operation that can take its tenant from more than one source resolves it ONCE, and refuses rather than picking a winner
39. Scope the read, not just the write
40. Any middleware that resolves a tenant must publish it via `ResolvedTenant.Publish(context, guid, source)` (`Birko.Data.Tenant/Middleware/ResolvedTenant.cs`)
41. A mapper that cannot express something refuses; it never drops it quietly
42. A translator that cannot express a node REFUSES it, and "nothing was produced" is never a scope answer — because the same empty state also means "constrains nothing", which is a different thing
43. A collapse that unwraps a group must COMBINE the enclosing flags, not assign over them — and the destructive guard cannot help, because the clause it produces is non-empty and simply wrong
44. A sub-translation that fails must not leave a query that MEANS something else — and a guard on the top-level result cannot see it, because the result is non-null
45. A caller's value that reaches a query LANGUAGE is contained by choosing a query type with no grammar, not by escaping the grammar
46. Where a driver has no usable default, the framework picks one — once, at a funnel, with the consumer winning
47. A language-level overload change is a framework-wide event: normalise it ONCE, wire it where it actually breaks
48. Where two layers can each define an identity, ONE of them owns it — and the tell is a silently empty result, not an error
49. Lazy schema-ensure degrades and reports; an explicit schema call throws
50. TASK-204's degrade-and-report rule has a SECOND sink, and the test for "may I degrade this?" is whether anything DECLARED it — not whether it sounds important
51. A provider without a conditional form has to fake one, and the flag that turns it off has to be honourable everywhere — otherwise it is a silent no-op wearing a parameter's name
52. A provider-specific ceiling is fixed at the provider, and "the declaration is wrong" is a claim to measure before acting on it
53. A fallback branch nobody can reach is not a safety net — it is a second implementation that drifts, and it can invalidate the tests of the first
54. A hypothesis you cannot reproduce gets FALSIFIED or recorded — never quietly adopted, and never "confirmed" by a run of green
55. A builder whose every method returns `this` has a silent option at every step — so it must honour a declaration or refuse it, never accept one and do nothing
56. A deliberately-unfixed gap is closed by the measurement it was waiting for — and the test that recorded it is inverted, not deleted
57. A constraint whose SHAPE cannot express the rule must change shape — and the change is scoped to the declarations that are actually broken
58. A constraint whose scope is "some rows" has to be DECLARED, and where a provider cannot express it each polarity is answered separately, on measurement
59. State a host reads must be current state, keyed — not an append-only log
60. `IsNullOrEmpty` on a parameter whose `null` MEANS something converts a missing configuration value into a different behaviour — and the tell is that its neighbours fail loudly on the same input
61. A test teardown that reaches process-wide state damages a PARALLEL sibling, and the victim is never the file that caused it
62. A process-wide cached object keeps attracting per-caller state, and the only thing that stops the next instance is a test
63. A check that compares DECLARED against STORED asks the schema for the stored side, never the driver — and the declared side is the method that emits the DDL
64. DDL that names something only a registration provides makes every connection a participant — the connector is its one producer, and any other connection must register or it fails
65. A denied action answers 403 when the caller may read the resource and 404 when they may not — and "unauthenticated" is 401, decided before anything is looked up

## Task tracking — this directory is the monorepo's aggregator

The framework lives in **one git repo** (`Birko-Framework/Birko.Framework`): every `Birko.*`
shared project is a top-level directory, every `Birko.*.Tests` project sits under `tests/`, and
this directory (`Birko.Framework/`) is its **aggregator** — the `.slnx`, the shared CLAUDE docs,
and the plan. This is the aggregator override the generic `tasks` skill's shape detection defers to:

- **All tasks live in this directory's `tasks/`.** There is one repo, so the walk-up-to-`.git`
  rule lands every task here by construction. An EPIC still lists the projects it touches in
  `affects:` (e.g. `affects: [Birko.AI, Birko.Data.Core]`) — that is now a *scope* annotation for
  spec regeneration, not a routing instruction.
- `docs/features/` and `docs/specs/` likewise live here, family-wide.

> **This closes a contradiction the old model carried.** § Task tracking used to prescribe filing
> single-sub-project work "in that sub-repo's own `tasks/`" while **1 of 178** sub-projects
> actually had a `tasks/` folder, and `/tasks pick`, the dashboard and [[fix-next]] all ran from
> the aggregator — so the prescribed location was filed and scheduled by nothing (recorded at
> TASK-449, deliberately left as a convention decision). The monorepo removes the split rather
> than resolving it.

### Integration model — commit to `main`, one commit per repo

`tasks/.config.yml` sets `integration: single-branch`: **this family does not branch per task**, so
`/tasks pick` offers no `task/TASK-NNN` branch and `/tasks close` skips its merge step. **One fix is
ONE commit** — production change, regression suite and task file land together. The full rules, and
why atomicity is load-bearing rather than tidy, are in [CLAUDE-maintenance.md](CLAUDE-maintenance.md)
§ Integration model.

⚠ Three of them bite on *every* commit, so they stay here rather than one file away:

- **Stage explicitly. Never `git add -A`.**
- **No `Co-Authored-By:` trailer.** Standing preference; overrides the harness default. Don't copy it
  from older commits that carry it.
- **Do not split a fix from its test across commits.** `git bisect`, CI and `git revert` all break
  quietly when you do — see the maintenance file for the measurement.

## Skills shipped by this repo

`.claude/skills/` is the home of the Birko-specific skills. They **build on top of the generic
project-lifecycle-skills set** (never the reverse — the generic skills know only a "stack
scaffolder" hook, not Birko). Project-local ones (new-birko-subproject, new-store-backend,
verify-birko-conventions, roll-birko-changelog) are reachable only inside this repo — **and reachability
comes from a distinct name, not from shadowing.** Measured at TASK-267: a skill name present at both
`~/.claude/skills/` and this repo's `.claude/skills/` resolves **user-level first**, so the two that used
to share a generic name (`verify-conventions`, `roll-changelog`) never ran at all, and every close gate
silently linted with the generic skill while the repo believed otherwise. Project-local skills *are*
discovered — one with no user-level twin resolves here — so the defect was precedence, never discovery.
The gate is now wired the other way round: the generic `verify-conventions` **globs for
`.claude/skills/verify-*conventions*/SKILL.md`**, runs its own pass, hands off, and names the extension
on its report header — reporting a **blocker** if it finds one it did not run. So the Birko checks are
reachable through either door, and a run that skipped them says so instead of reporting a clean pass; the
consumer-facing ones (birko-new-project, new-birko-web-page, new-birko-web-component,
design-agent) are shared user-level via [install-skills.cs](install-skills.cs)
(`dotnet run install-skills.cs` — a junction on Windows, a symlink on Linux; edit here, live
immediately).

## Code Style
- **Guard clauses:** Use early returns instead of wrapping entire method bodies in if blocks. Prefer `if (x == null) return;` over `if (x != null) { ... }`.
- **No nullable warnings:** All new code must compile without CS8600–CS8605, CS8618, CS8625. Use proper null checks, `!` only when provably safe, or `?` annotations.

## Testing
- All test projects use **xUnit + FluentAssertions**
- **Tests live under `tests/` in the same repo:** `Birko.{Project}`'s tests are at
  `tests/Birko.{Project}.Tests/`, and import the project under test as
  `..\..\Birko.{Project}\Birko.{Project}.projitems`. A fix and its regression suite are **one
  commit** — see the integration model above. Run with `dotnet test --nologo` from the test project.
- Every new public functionality must have corresponding tests in `Birko.{ProjectName}.Tests`
- Test both success and failure cases; include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Each test project has its own `CLAUDE.md` describing scope and conventions
- See [CLAUDE-maintenance.md](CLAUDE-maintenance.md) for test requirements on new projects and health check patterns

## Recent Updates
### Birko.Health.Security.Grants: a health check for grants that grant nothing (2026-10-17)
[[TASK-654]]. New project. `StaleGrantHealthCheck(store, table)` reports the stored grants whose role or resource type the
`GrantRoleTable` no longer declares. Since TASK-641 they grant nothing, so a role renamed in configuration quietly removed
access. Degraded with the count and up to 50 descriptions, Degraded when the store cannot be read, Healthy with none,
never Unhealthy. The admin grant is ignored; nothing is revoked.
### A DateTime keeps its sub-second digits on MySQL and SQL Server (2026-10-17)
[[TASK-656]]. Measured live: MySQL stored a `DateTime` to the second (`DATETIME`), and SQL Server rounded it to ~3.33 ms
because SqlClient infers a `datetime` parameter, though the column was `DATETIME2`. Exact-value filters matched nothing and
writes within a second tied. MySQL columns are now `DATETIME(6)`, and SQL Server binds `DATETIME2`. An existing MySQL
`DATETIME` column is reported as drift; widening it with `ALTER … MODIFY … DATETIME(6)` is the operator's step.
### A migration's DropField drops the field; a DropIndex that cannot drop refuses (2026-10-17)
[[TASK-655]]. Measured live: on MongoDB, RavenDB, Cosmos DB and ElasticSearch `DropField` left every document carrying the
field, and ElasticSearch and Cosmos `DropIndex` did nothing, yet the migration was recorded. `DropField` now removes the field
from every document (on ElasticSearch the mapping keeps it until a reindex). Cosmos `DropIndex` drops by name; ElasticSearch
and InfluxDB `DropIndex` refuse, as their `CreateIndex` does. Cosmos `RenameField` on a plain client: [[TASK-659]].
### SQL connection strings quote their credentials on every provider (2026-10-17)
[[TASK-653]]. **Security.** Measured live: on SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB a password ending `;Server=evil`
moved the connection to that host, `;Encrypt=False` dropped TLS, and a `;` or quote broke the connection. Every provider
now composes through its driver's builder, with one producer shared by the settings type and the connector's
`RemoteSettings` path. Key spellings follow the builders (`Data Source`, `Connect Timeout`, MySQL `SSL Mode`).
### MongoDB, Cosmos DB and InfluxDB units of work end the boundary on every outcome (2026-10-17)
[[TASK-578]]. Measured live: MongoDB never disposed its session after a commit or rollback, a refused Cosmos batch threw
`InvalidOperationException` and a throwing one stayed active, and a failed InfluxDB write kept its points for a retry to
re-send. Each now releases what it holds, a refused Cosmos batch is a `UnitOfWorkException`, and the rollback after a
failed commit is a no-op, as on SQL and Elasticsearch. RavenDB: [[TASK-658]].
### The async SQL model repository takes its connector type (2026-10-17)
[[TASK-576]]. **Signature change:** `AsyncDataBaseModelRepository<T>` is now `AsyncDataBaseModelRepository<TConnector, T>`,
as the sync one is. Measured: it checked for `AsyncDataBaseBulkStore<AbstractConnector, T>`, which by generic invariance no
provider store is, so it refused every store (no caller could have used it). It now exposes `Connector` and the init hooks.
### The distributed event bus gives each message its own DI scope (2026-10-17)
[[TASK-566]]. Measured: a handler with a scoped dependency threw on every delivery under `ValidateScopes`, and at startup
in `AutoSubscriber`; otherwise every message shared one root-owned dependency that was never disposed. Each delivered
message now resolves its handlers from its own scope, disposed after dispatch, as `InProcessEventBus` does (TASK-565).
Discovery asks `IServiceProviderIsService` and builds no handler.
### Spec-regen cleanup: ambiguous fields, address headers, index settings (2026-10-17)
[[TASK-651]]. Fixed from the 2026-10-16 spec regeneration. A `DictionaryRuleContext` field matching two keys only ignoring case now throws instead of taking the first. `RuleSet.Rules` copies the list it is given, and `RuleGroup.Rules = null` is refused. `GetClientIpAddress` returns only a parsed address: `unknown` in X-Forwarded-For had been returned as the IP. An ES `CopyData` with `{}` is a plain copy. `ByName("guid")` is the Guid key. ES index settings refuse negative numbers. Mongo text-index fields compare as a set. `[ViewField]` is not a column on a mapped model.

### A partial index is declared through IndexDefinition (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-636]]. `IndexDefinition.WhereNotNull` / `WhereNull` declare a partial index. MongoDB creates it, reads it back
and compares it for drift; on MongoDB, `IDefaultMarker`'s unique index no longer has to be created by hand. SQL carries
the predicates; RavenDB, Cosmos DB and ElasticSearch refuse them. Drift reports `PredicateDiffers`.
### Tenant sync refuses an unscopable TenantGuid; Cosmos partition path and index verbs agree (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-650]]. Measured: a run scoped to one tenant read every tenant's rows when `TenantGuid` was not a `Guid`; it now
refuses. Cosmos treats an empty `PartitionKeyPath` as `/id` at creation too. Its index verbs agree on an unregistered
name, and a read no longer creates the registry container. The ElasticSearch Init NRE was refuted (unreachable).
### Save of a soft-deleted entity is refused; Restore brings it back (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-649]]. Measured: `Save` fell through to a create of the same Guid, which InMemory, SQLite and PostgreSQL refused as
a duplicate key ("use Update or Save"). It now throws `EntitySoftDeletedException`, and `Restore` / `RestoreAsync` on the
soft-delete wrapper is the explicit way back.
### An ElasticSearch reindex reports a cancellation as one (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-648]]. Measured: NEST answers a cancelled request with an invalid response, so every cancelled reindex came back
`Failed`. `IndexManager` and the reindex calls now rethrow the cancellation. An alias reindex cancelled before the swap
removes its new index; one cancelled after it succeeds with a `CleanupError`.
### Sync versions a written side as stored, asks Custom without a pair, reports a failure once (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-647]]. Measured: every SQL provider and MongoDB read `UpdatedAt` back with another precision or Kind, so an item
written by sync read as changed next run, and the lossy copy overwrote the precise source. Written sides are now read
back before their version is recorded. Custom is asked about an item with no recorded pair. Every failure reaches
`result.Errors` and `OnError` once. MySQL / SQL Server precision itself is [[TASK-656]].
### Rule `Between` and `In` no longer round a fractional value (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-645]]. Measured: `Qty Between 10.5..20` selected Qty 10 at the store and `Qty In [10.6]` selected 11, while
the in-memory evaluator compared exactly. Each bound and candidate now goes through the comparison TASK-171 fixed,
so both engines agree.
### ElasticSearch refuses a comparison it cannot translate instead of testing existence (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-644]]. Measured: `x.Text == x.Text.Trim()` and `x.Owner.Name == x.Text` ran as "Text is missing", because an
untranslatable operand looked like `null`. Only an operand that refers to no parameter is a null comparison now;
anything else throws `NotSupportedException`.
### InfluxDB field renames and ElasticSearch index checks no longer report false success (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-642]], [[TASK-643]]. Measured: an InfluxDB migration calling `RenameField` or `DropField` was recorded as
applied having changed nothing; both now refuse. The ElasticSearch schema builder read an unreachable cluster as
"index absent" and never checked its create or delete; it now throws. Other backends' `DropField` is [[TASK-655]].
### Repository gaps TASK-162 left (2026-10-17)

[[TASK-646]]. Measured: an async repository's `UpdateAsync` / `DeleteAsync` with no store reported success, while
every other call refuses. `AddRepository<TRepository>(store)` threw unless given a lifetime, because its default was
`Scoped`, which it refuses; the default is now `Singleton`. The sync bulk ViewModel delete now prunes its hashes.
The rolling per-change log now lives entirely in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) (newest-first). Add new architectural / behavioral change notes here as `### Title (YYYY-MM-DD)` entries; **roll the oldest into CHANGELOG.md whenever the ENTRIES exceed ~10 KB** — measure it, do not eyeball it:

```sh
awk '/^## Recent Updates/{s=1} s&&/^### /{f=1} f' CLAUDE.md | wc -c
```

The project-local `/roll-birko-changelog` skill performs the roll; mind the name, because the generic `/roll-changelog` resolves user-level first (§ Skills) and does not know this file. Granular code-review-remediation progress is tracked in `tasks/EPIC-014-code-review-remediation`, not here.

⚠ **The budget counts BYTES OF ENTRIES, and both halves of that were earned.** The rule it replaces said "past ~5–8 entries" — measured 2026-09-19, **7 entries, inside that limit, were 31 KB: 52% of this file**, because an entry had grown from a paragraph to a 36–59 line essay since the rule was written. A file *just* cut from 408 KB to 50 KB (`68b26b5b`, the rulebook split) was back to 59.6 KB four commits later, reporting itself compliant the whole way — and the monorepo migration, which got the blame, had changed it by **24 bytes**. Then the first byte budget written here measured the whole **section**, counted this very paragraph as log content, and tripped on itself the moment it was saved. **A threshold counts the thing that grows — not the thing that is easy to count, and not itself.**
